# GraphCroc
This is the repo of our work, GraphCroc: Cross-Correlation Autoencoder for Graph Structural Reconstruction, in NeurIPS(2024).

<img src="figs/framework.png" alt="framework"/>

## üèñÔ∏è Environment
GraphCroc is developed on [PyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Generally, please ensure `PyTorch >= 1.11.0`, `python >= 3.8`, and `pyg >= 2.0.4`. Other depedency might be required as well.

## üõ´ Code Take-off
Current GraphCroc repo is hard coded, and a more structural one is growing.
1. Create folder `resLog` and `tdModels` to save results.
2. Main file for training GraphCroc: `cd IMDB_B; python3 reconstructor.py`
3. WL-test: `python3 wl_test.py`
4. Graph classification task (100-epoch sample): `python3 gc_train.py`
